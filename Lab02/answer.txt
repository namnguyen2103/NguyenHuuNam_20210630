8. Create Constructor method
- Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- A: There will be an error, as this new constructor method will have the same signature as the "Create a DVD object by title" one.
